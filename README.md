- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sameer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Quantum Optics (Molecular QED, Photon Entanglement) and its applications to Quantum Computing. I also love listening to and talking about superconductivity and other cool phyiscs in condensed matter systems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also interested in mentoring engineering majors, particularly but necessarily, from India to switch to Physics. If you have any questions or have some interesting projects in mind, do reach out to me!
